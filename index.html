            <span class="text-wrapper-25"
              >Climate change happens over time, generally over decades or more. Climate variability, on the other hand,
              comprises changes that occur over shorter time periods, such as a month, season, or year. Climate
              variability describes the system&#39;s natural fluctuation. One abnormally cold or rainy year followed by
              an unusually warm or dry year, for example, would not be seen as an indicator of climate change.</span

            <span class="text-wrapper-25"
              >Despite global warming, certain locations may see unusually cold or snowy winters. These cold periods are
              caused by local weather pattern variability, which can result in colder-than-average seasons or even
              colder-than-average years at the local or regional level. In reality, a warmer environment holds more
              water vapour in the air, which can cause heavier snowfall in some regions. A warmer climate can lead to
              larger snowstorms as long as it is cold enough to snow.</span

            <span class="span">Do natural variations in climate contribute to today’s climate change?<br /></span>
            <span class="text-wrapper-25"
              >Natural cycles of warming and cooling occur on Earth as a result of variables such as variations in the
              sun&#39;s position or volcanic activity. There were instances in the distant past, for example, when the
              world was warmer than it is now. Natural temperature changes, however, do not explain today&#39;s climate
              change. The majority of the warming since 1950 has been driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases from
              various activities, notably the usage of fossil fuels.</span

              >A degree or two change in average global temperature may not seem like much of a concern, but relatively
              small changes in the earth&#39;s average temperature can cause significant changes in local and regional
              climate, posing threats to public health and safety, water resources, agriculture, infrastructure, and
              ecosystems. The 2018 National Climate Assessment cites numerous examples, including an increase in heat
              waves and days with temperatures above 90°F; more extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, and
              floods; and a projected sea level rise of 1 to 4 feet by the end of the century, which could submerge
              certain areas of the country.</span

              > People may lessen the dangers of climate change by adopting decisions that reduce greenhouse gas
              emissions and planning for future changes. People&#39;s decisions now will impact the globe for decades,
              if not centuries, to come. Communities may also prepare for changes in the next decades by identifying and
              mitigating vulnerabilities and incorporating climate change risks into planning and development. Such
              steps can safeguard the most vulnerable groups, such as small children, the elderly, and those living in
              poverty, from the health and safety risks posed by climate change.</span

            <span class="text-wrapper-25"
              > The longer people wait to address climate change, the more detrimental its impacts on the earth and
              people&#39;s health will be. If individuals do not act quickly, more harsh and costly actions to keep
              greenhouse gases from surpassing harmful levels may be required later. According to the most recent
              National Climate Assessment, global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could save tens of
              thousands of lives in the United States each year by the end of the century, as well as billions of
              dollars in damages from water scarcity, wildfires, agricultural losses, flooding, and other effects.
              People may take a variety of steps right now to help lower the danger of climate change while also
              enhancing the natural environment and community infrastructure.</span
